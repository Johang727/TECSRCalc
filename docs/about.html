    <b>What do the statistics mean?</b><br><br>

    <b>M</b>ean <b>S</b>quared <b>E</b>rror: The average squared difference between actual and predicted values<br>
    |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The higher the value, the less accurate the model is.<br>
    <b>R2</b> (R-Squared): How well the regression tree fits the data.<br>
    |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The closer to 1, the better<br>
    |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Despite my models having a high R2, this does not directly equate to it's accuracy. There are more factors that go into SR and the SR economy will always change. <br><br>

    <b>The first two models...</b><br>
    I only had the Random Forest model, which was good for what it's meant for: interpolation, guessing a value within the training data. However, going outside the SR range for my data resulted in no extrapolation, guessing a value outside of the training data.<br><br>
    This meant that the model was really good at returning accurate results for the 2K-17K range, but not good for anything outside of that. The model would never return values under 2K or above 17K. Therefore, I decided to introduce a model that can "guess" values outside the training data's range.<br><br>
    Rather than replace the model entirely, I decided to have two models instead, switching to the alternate model which supports extrapolation when needed.<br><br>

    <b>...and the rest?</b><br>
    The rest are experimental models, essentially made out of curiousity. Some of these are... less practical than others<br>

    |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Gradient Boosting<br>
    |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Similar to the Random Forest, but rather than each "tree" being independent, the trees learn from each other and improve based off of that.<br>
